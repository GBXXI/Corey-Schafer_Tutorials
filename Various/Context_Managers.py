On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. And the hat. She's a witch! Why do you think that she is a witch? And the hat. She's a witch! Did you dress her up like this? Bring her forward!

Burn her anyway! But you are dressed as oneâ€¦ What a strange person. No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart.

Well, I didn't vote for you. The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. How do you know she is a witch?

He hasn't got shit all over him. You don't vote for kings. Why do you think that she is a witch? Now, look here, my good man.

Burn her! Bring her forward! Well, I got better. Look, my liege!

We found them. Oh, ow! Burn her! Bring her forward! How do you know she is a witch?

Well, what do you want? A newt? I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!

Well, I didn't vote for you. I have to push the pram a lot. Burn her anyway! Well, how'd you become king, then?

Well, we did do the nose. You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!""")
