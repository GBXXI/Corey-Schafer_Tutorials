
Virtual Environments
3rd party library pipenv Module.

# Creating an new virtual environment:
- Inside the folder we want to create the virtual environment
    on the command prompt, we type:

    D:\GBXXI\PROGRAMMING\GB_Python\Corey Schafer_Tutorials\Modules> pipenv install

        note:
            - If we already have a pipenv file in that folder, this command will recreate the virtual environment described in the aforementioned file.

# Activating a virtual environment:
- Inside the folder we want to create the virtual environment
    on the command prompt, we type:

    D:\GBXXI\PROGRAMMING\GB_Python\Corey Schafer_Tutorials\Modules> pipenv shell

        where:
            -This command, opens a sub-shell for us to work on our virtual environment.

# Deactivating a virtual environment:
- Inside the folder we want to create the virtual environment
    on the command prompt, we type:

    D:\GBXXI\PROGRAMMING\GB_Python\Corey Schafer_Tutorials\Modules> exit

        where:
            -This command, closes the sub-shell for we used to work on our virtual environment.

# Running commands to our virtual environment without activating it.
- Inside the folder we want to create the virtual environment
    on the command prompt, we type:

    D:\GBXXI\PROGRAMMING\GB_Python\Corey Schafer_Tutorials\Modules> pipenv run python

        where:
            -The virtual's environment python interpreter is launched.

# Installing packages for a virtual environment from requirements.txt:
-Inside our virtual environment we give the command:

    (project_env) D:\Test GB Python\Corey Schafer_Tutorials> pipenv install -r requirements.txt

# Extracting the environment's requirements.
-Inside our virtual environment we give the command:

    (project_env) D:\Test GB Python\Corey Schafer_Tutorials>pipenv lock -r

        copying all the modules name and version and putting them inside a
        requirements.txt file

# Installing packages in a dev environment.
-Inside our virtual environment we give the command:

    (project_env) D:\Test GB Python\Corey Schafer_Tutorials>pipenv install pytest --dev

# Removing installed packages.
-Inside our virtual environment we give the command:

    (project_env) D:\Test GB Python\Corey Schafer_Tutorials>pipenv uninstall pytest

# Deleting a virtual environment:
-Inside the project's folder we give the command:

    (project_env) D:\Test GB Python\Corey Schafer_Tutorials>pipenv --rm

# Checking for package security.
-Inside our virtual environment we give the command:

    (project_env) D:\Test GB Python\Corey Schafer_Tutorials>pipenv check

# Display a dependency graph of our packages.
-Inside our virtual environment we give the command:

    (project_env) D:\Test GB Python\Corey Schafer_Tutorials>pipenv graph

# Updating our deterministic virtual environment file, pipfile.lock.
-Inside our virtual environment we give the command:

    (project_env) D:\Test GB Python\Corey Schafer_Tutorials>pipenv lock

# Creating an environment from our deterministic file.
-Inside our virtual environment we give the command:

    (project_env) D:\Test GB Python\Corey Schafer_Tutorials>pipenv install --ignore-pipfile

# Setting environment variables inside our virtual environment.
-Inside our virtual environment directory we create a
.env file and in that file we edit the environment variables we want accessable from our virtual environment.
